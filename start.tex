          Welcome, Gladiator

 You lead a band of mercenaries 
and adventurers, each seeking to 
earn glory and gold in this hostile 
world through conquest.  With only 
the money you stole from an imperial 
guardsman, along with your allies 
Troy and the Commander, you must 
choose your troops wisely in
order to survive, and make a profit.

  Don't forget to train your 
troops once you have the money, as 
sufficient skill overcomes superior 
numbers. After each successful 
mission, you will have the opportunity 
to squander your profits.  Save often, 
as you may quickly regret your choices.

  Remember, Troy and Commander
are your friends, but not under your
pay.  You can't train them, and they
may leave your team at any time.

  Now, go out and seek your fortune...
