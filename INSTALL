These are the installation instructions for Openglad.

INSTALL
=======

1. Unpack the tarball into some directory.

==================================
Linux/FreeBSD/OpenBSD/Other Unixes
==================================
1. In the openglad dir, run "./configure"
2. Run "make"
3. Run "make install"

Note: if you are installing without use of autoconf,
you will need to create a config.h file with proper
defines (such as DATADIR), then install Openglad into
DATADIR.

=======
Windows
=======
A Visual C++ Makefile can be found in src/. You might need to
edit the paths to the SDL lib/includes. To from the command line, execute
vcvars32.bat (should be in VC98/) and then execute nmake /f Makefile.vc 
(or nmake /f Makefile.vc openscen) in the openglad src/ dir. (Thanks Murlock)

Note: a config.h-win is provided that you'll have to rename into config.h.

For the install, there are several ways to have Openglad installed:

1. Have the openglad.cfg file be in C:\Games\Openglad and have the "data" option in it pointing to where you have the rest of Openglad installed.
2. Have the whole thing in C:\Games\Openglad
3. Have it anywhere but always switch to the install directory before launching it.

Note: be sure to have the save/ scen/ and pix/ directories, or saving the game and/or level editing won't work.

===========
===========

openglad is the game binary, openscen is the editor.


If you get Openglad to work on any other operating systems,
please tell us how you did. You can contact one of the
Snowstorm Entertainment guys or post on the forums.
